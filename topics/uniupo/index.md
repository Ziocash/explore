The Università degli Studi del Piemonte Orientale "Amedeo Avogadro" was officially born on 30 July 1998, when the Minister of Universities and Scientific Research and Technology, Luigi Berlinguer, signed the charter. The choice of the illustrious Piedmont scientist (who taught in Vercelli for a number of years) for the university’s name was due to his worldwide fame following his formulation of the Number of particles in a mole.
